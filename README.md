# psichiR

This repo contains coding exercises from the [PsiChiR challenge](https://osf.io/pd64c/), kindly put together by Jordan Wagge. It is a great way to learn R via interactions with real data challenges. Each month, Jordan sets a data challenge with 4 levels; Level 1 usually involves some data cleaning/manipulation, Level 2 involves getting descriptive statistics, Level 3 involves some data visualisation, and Level 4 involves inferential statistics.

Here is a list of skills learned in each challenge, in case you want to learn something in particular. The exercises are grouped according to the datafile that they use (i.e. 2020 March-May.Rmd).
