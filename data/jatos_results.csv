The research study aims to investigate the relationship between decision-making and people&apos;s approach to effort, as well as their real-world relevance. You have been invited to participate because you are studying PSYC1A or PSYC1B at UNSW.<br><br>       <b>Who is conducting this research?</b><br>			The study is being carried out by the following researchers: Lara Guerreiro and Steven B. Most, UNSW Sydney School of Psychology<br><br>			<b>Do I have to take part in this research study?</b><br>			Participation in this research study is voluntary. If you do not want to take part, you do not have to. If you decide to take part and later change your mind, you are free to withdraw from the study at any stage.<br><br>			<b>What does participation in this research require, and are there any risks involved?</b><br>If you decide to take part in this research study, we will ask you to provide information about yourself, including your UNSW student number, your age and gender, as well as information regarding your current and previous course enrolment at UNSW. 
    You will answer some questions about your approach to schoolwork. You will be asked to type a number of words backwards and then will engage in a series of choices 
    between rewards that either do or do not require effort. At the end, you will be asked whether you provide consent to one final question. We don&apos;t expect this 
    research to cause any harm. However, you may skip any or all written or verbal questions if you wish.  Please let the researchers know if you need any assistance for any reason.<br><br>     <b>What are the possible benefits to participation?</b><br>     We cannot promise that you will receive any benefits from this study, but we hope to use the findings from this study to better understand people&apos;s approaches to effort. <br><br>			<b>What will happen to information about me?</b><br>			The information that you give us will be stored indefinitely after the project&apos;s completion. Although your UNSW Student ID will initially be linked with your data, it will be removed upon the study&apos;s completion, at which point your data will be deidentified, with your Student ID replaced with non-identifiable, unique participant identifier numbers.  		Researchers at UNSW are requested to store their aggregated research data in the UNSW data repository, this is a system called ResData. Once the aggregated data are deposited into this repository, they will be retained in this system permanently, but in a format where your data will not be individually identifiable.			Answers that you give during the study may be used for publication, and may be shared with other researchers. However this data will be de-identified meaning that it will not be linked to personal information about you.<br><br>			<b>Total Participation Time and Recompense to Participants</b><br>			In total, participation in this study will require about 30 minutes. You will receive 0.5 credit points as recompense for your participation. </b> <br><br>			<b>How and when will I find out what the results of the research study are?</b><br>			The research team intend to publish and/ report the results of the research study in a variety of ways. All information published will be done in a way that will not identify you. If you would like to receive a copy of the results you can let the research team know by e-mailing A/Prof Steven Most (s.most@unsw.edu.au).

You may close this window. If you are interested in learning more about this study and its purpose please see below further information.</p><ol style=""text-align:left;line-height:190%;margin:16px 80px;"" type=""1""><li><b>  Research questions: </b><br></li><p style=""text-align:left;line-height:190%;"">Is there a correlation between an individual&apos;s self-reported procrastination tendencies and performance in an effort discounting task, and do these measures predict academic performance in PSYC 1A and 1B? Effort discounting refers to a tendency for people to select the lower of two rewards if it entails less effort to receive it. </p><li><b>  How does this study extend on previous research on this topic? </b><br></li><p style=""text-align:left;line-height:190%;"">Previous research (Johnson & Most, 2023) has demonstrated that people often engage in more effort discounting if the effort is imminent than when assigning the effort to their future selves. This may be considered an objective analogue of tendency to procrastinate effort. This study will extend on this research by investigating an additional characteristic, whether self-reported procrastination and effort discounting indeed correlate with each other. For those participants who grant permission, we will additionally test whether one or both measures predicts academicperformance in PSYC 1A and 1B.</p><li><b>  Potential real-world implications: </b><br></li><p style=""text-align:left;line-height:190%;"">Determining a correlation between self-reported procrastination and performance in effort discounting tasks has potential real-life implications in understanding the outcomes and consequences of procrastination. Procrastination is not unique to academic studies and can be experienced by everyone in their daily living. Therefore, by understanding the potential consequences of having higher traits of procrastination and whether it is correlated with people&apos;s decision making and/or performance in academic studies may lead to the development of strategies that people can adopt to avoid procrastination if we know it is in their best interest.</p><li><b>  Briefly describe a potential issue or limitation of the study </b><br></li><p style=""text-align:left;line-height:190%;"">A potential practical issue of this study is that participants may not provide consent for us to collect their grades. This will limit the effects we are able to observe, however if we are unable to collect this data, the study will still be valid in exploring the relationship between self-reported procrastination and effort discounting. A possible limitation of the study is also that it is to be conducted online with participants completing the experiment in their own time and space. This means there are limits to how controlled the study is and we cannot guarantee participants&apos; full focus and attention. However, the experiment will have clear instructions asking participants to be in a quiet, distraction free room and we will recruit a large sample size to ensure accurate average results. </p><li><b>  Briefly describe the study methodology </b><br></li><p style=""text-align:left;line-height:190%;"">The design of this study combines within-subjects manipulations of the amount timing of hypothetical effort and between-subjects measure of self-reported procrastination and PSYC 1A and 1B class grades. Dependent variables include score in Academic Procrastination Scale -Short Form, choices on effort discounting task, and PSYC 1A and 1B class grades. In the effort discounting task, independent variables are the level of effort (i.e., number of words typed backwards) and temporal distance (i.e., whether the effort is imagined to be imminent or in the future).</p><li><b>  Further readings </b><br></li><p style=""text-align:left;line-height:190%;"">Johnson, S.
